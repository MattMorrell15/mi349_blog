            <p>Test programs have always existed in software development, but the tradition of using "Hello, World!" as a text message was influenced by an example program in the 1978 book The C Programming Language. The example was taken from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian Kernighan, one of the co-creators of the Unix operating system.</p>

            <p>Sextants can be used for accurate measurements in day or night because it allows direct observations of stars relative to the horizon. It remains accurate even on moving ships due to the relative angle measurement between the celestial object and the horizon. As long as both the object and hortizon are within view, thte sextant's accuracy will be high even amongst large movements on a vessel. Because of this accuracy, the sectant remains a reliable backup for signal=based navigation instruments like GPS.</p>
